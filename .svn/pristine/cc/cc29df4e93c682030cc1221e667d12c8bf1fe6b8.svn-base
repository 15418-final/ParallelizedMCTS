/** A time record contains time-related information.
    How much time each player has left, how overtime is regulated, and how
    many moves there are left in this overtime period. This information is
    updated when replaying a game depending on time-related properties stored
    in the game tree.

    A time contest: dynamic time record of an ongoing game.
    The time left at each point in the game is stored as properties in the
    tree. The time stored is the time left when entering a new node; the
    time left while the clock is running at a node is not stored anywhere
    except in the TimeContest object. Thus leaving a node and returning to
    it later will restore the time left when first entering the node, not
    when leaving the node.
