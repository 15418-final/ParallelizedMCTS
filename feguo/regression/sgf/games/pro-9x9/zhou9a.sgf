C[Daeton [6k\]: atari?
Archaic [1d\]: er
truespirit [8k\]: how strong is mogo on 9x9?
Archaic [1d\]: are computers good at 9x9
sameoldG [-\]: mogo is 9p on 9x9
Daeton [6k\]: better than 19x19
truespirit [8k\]: O_o
Accelerate [3k\]: how strong is nutngo? o.O
Kirby [2k\]: the pro is black?
Gynn [13k?\]: 9pro
truespirit [8k\]: 9p
Accelerate [3k\]: okay
Archaic [1d\]: is this a performance test
Archaic [1d\]: for computers
Kirby [2k\]: bleh, 7.5 komi
Archaic [1d\]: and algorithms
Kirby [2k\]: that sucks
pasky [-\]: kirby, why?
truespirit [8k\]: i dont really like computer go
truespirit [8k\]: but
Kirby [2k\]: 7.5 komi seems inappropriate for a 9x9 board
pasky [-\]: kirby, you might want to read tromp's excellent user \
info ;)
truespirit [8k\]: its interestin
Archaic [1d\]: is this some sort of...
Archaic [1d\]: anythin special about this
truespirit [8k\]: 7.5 is chinese komi?
Daeton [6k\]: other than it being a 9p vs. computer?
Wasiqi [13k\]: Isn't this two computers playing each other?
Kirby [2k\]: seems tromp's info is just about scoring methods
mmueller [4d?\]: Fuego thinks 53% for White
pasky [-\]: kirby: oh wait yes, i didn't read it carefully enough \
before
bolb [-\]: Zhou Junxun 9p vs MoGo
LapinBlanc [2d?\]: Thanks for the evaluation Martin!
Kirby [2k\]: are you the teacher, pasky?  some guy on kgs has \
a website with quizzes that you can print out and give to students
mmueller [4d?\]: On my old laptop :)
pasky [-\]: i thought it also explains why even and odd komi is \
equivalent in area scoring
pasky [-\]: kirby: huh?
Kirby [2k\]: ok nevermind
yank [?\]: Is there a komi?
Kirby [2k\]: maybe that was sabaki

truespirit [8k\]: capture?
tromp [-\]: yes, w will capture
quasimoyo [2d\]: 100 minutes, its not too much for 9x9?
Gynn [13k?\]:  How can you tell?
truespirit [8k\]: so mogo is 0p on 9x9, thats pretty fantastic \
i think
truespirit [8k\]: 9p*
DanielFox [-\]: mogo needs the time, quasi
Oloril [2k\]: why not mogotitan?
Gynn [13k?\]: lol
mmueller [4d?\]: B needs to prevent D4 E5 E2
Kirby [2k\]: it's staged so the computer can win
Gynn [13k?\]: Why not Mogobot
HateToWin [?\]: i would like to see how good the bot is at blitz \
games ;)
Gynn [13k?\]: xD
DanielFox [-\]: not very!
truespirit [8k\]: i won in 5sec blitz against mogo
Archaic [1d\]: hi yank
truespirit [8k\]: and mogo took 9
DanielFox [-\]: rapyuta will be the last man standing against \
the robots
truespirit [8k\]: >_>
pasky [-\]: czechbot plays 10:00 SD 9x9 on a home computer and \
it's definitely kgs dan-level
truespirit [8k\]: hey
pasky [-\]: about 2d or 3d
yank [?\]: Hi, Archaic.
kuy30 [1d\]: what's hardware?
pasky [-\]: though that's not too blitz still ;)
truespirit [8k\]: the most awesome computer
tromp [-\]: well, i gues white cld consider g7 too
pasky [-\]: huy30: 600cpu huygens cluster]
BL[2610.336];W[af]
C[truespirit [8k\]: is a cellphone pprogram i had..]
WL[2226.982];B[eh]
C[HateToWin [?\]: it took it all that time to play the most obvious \
move.....
truespirit [8k\]: mogo needs to calculate no?
pasky [-\]: hatetowin, it's hard to distinguish obvious and non-obvious \
moves ;)
truespirit [8k\]: how many variations does mogo read?
Gynn [13k?\]: lol lets all guess what we thing the next move is: \
e3 
Kirby [2k\]: i would have played g6 instead of e2
quasimoyo [2d\]: this is the strongest bot, right?
HateToWin [?\]: thats why your 2k and he is 9p, kirby ;)
Oloril [2k\]: mogo lost to many faces of go I believe
XY0908 [-\]: So which one is the bot again?
Gynn [13k?\]: Mogo
pasky [-\]: kirby: did you count? :)
Kirby [2k\]: by playing g6 black gets the upper side, and w doesn't \
have much at bottom because he is split
Kirby [2k\]: seems reasonable to me
ketchup [4k\]: lol XY, best question asked so far
Kirby [2k\]: now w can take some of b's potential top territory
pasky [-\]: kirby: w has komi
truespirit [8k\]: xy0907
XY0908 [-\]: Kirby don't know how to count according to his wife.
Kirby [2k\]: it's true
truespirit [8k\]: is that graph coords xy?
Kirby [2k\]: i can only win by killing
pasky [-\]: kirby: b probably counted w would get enough points, \
with yose options along a6 etc.
ketchup [4k\]: komi..
pasky [-\]: kirby: it's so easy to slip to tight loss with mogo \
if you play the easy moves
mmueller [4d?\]: 54% now
Kirby [2k\]: however, maybe e2 is sente against the side so it's \
not so bad
XY0908 [-\]: let's predict what the bot would play next.
Kirby [2k\]: unless i read it wrong
XY0908 [-\]: I predict at D3
ketchup [4k\]: d3, f2, g2, g6, h6, a6 go go
pasky [-\]: i predict g7]
BL[2602.069];W[gd]
C[Kirby [2k\]: if g7 can't b c2?
pasky [-\]: c2 e8 is ok exchange for w
pasky [-\]: maybe even this is enough
Archaic [1d\]: no way b can win
kuy30 [1d\]: can b kill that group?
Kirby [2k\]: i think so
Kirby [2k\]: by c2 i think
tromp [-\]: c2 b2 b1 c3 w lives
Kirby [2k\]: c2 b2 c3
kuy30 [1d\]: how?
tromp [-\]: hmm
kuy30 [1d\]: how lives?
Archaic [1d\]: hey look
Archaic [1d\]: white's dead
LapinBlanc [2d?\]: White doesn't need to live, just to make 0.5 \
points more than black :)
ketchup [4k\]: yea why does it look like white's dead..
Meepy [-\]: c2, then white can b7 maybe?
ketchup [4k\]: in this case, needs to live to win lapinblanc :P
mmueller [4d?\]: Fuego likes C2 F7 for W
Kirby [2k\]: well if b kills this then w might get like 20ish \
points plus 7.5 komi and b gets like 37 points or something
Kirby [2k\]: i think
pasky [-\]: ketchup, that's not clear
kuy30 [1d\]: but there are questions about d4 e5 cut and c7 weakness
ketchup [4k\]: nothing is, but this is 9p...
pasky [-\]: depends on what magic w manages to pull off at the \
top
yank [?\]: Archaic, do you know how many points the komi is? 
pasky [-\]: ketchup: this is 600cpu cluster
Kirby [2k\]: how far can w go?  seems like f7 is the extent
Archaic [1d\]: 7.5
ketchup [4k\]: i put more faith in 9p :)
Kirby [2k\]: or f8
Kirby [2k\]: i think 9p has it
kuy30 [1d\]: I believe in MoGo
ketchup [4k\]: cant give up my humanity! :)
qwazidan [5k\]: c1
kuy30 [1d\]: future is not fir human
pasky [-\]: we will all die horrible death
mmueller [4d?\]: W can use aji of B3 group to get more at the \
top
DanielFox [-\]: what handicap will the 19x19 game be played at?
DanielFox [-\]: or is that to be determined
yank [?\]: I think 7.5 komi is too much for 9*9.
pasky [-\]: i think that will be determined
Kirby [2k\]: bleh, somebody pm me when the pro wins.  i'm going \
to do some work
ketchup [4k\]: lol
pasky [-\]: yank, afaik 7.5 and 6.5 is equivalent with chinese \
rules
kuy30 [1d\]: what's b thinking? are there better ways to kill \
than c2 ?
Archaic [1d\]: it's chinese rules
Archaic [1d\]: ?
sleep [12k\]: just curious what country is the 9p from?
ketchup [4k\]: b thinking, if i kill is it enough
Archaic [1d\]: how is 6.5 the same as 7.5
ketchup [4k\]: taiwan i believe
qwazidan [5k\]: komi is identical for games 9x9 and larger
ketchup [4k\]: http://go.nutn.edu.tw/2009/English/schedule_eng.htm
Archaic [1d\]: your saying using both 6.5 and 7.5 is same for \
chinese rules
tromp [-\]: they're quite different]
WL[2021.416]
;B[gc]
C[ketchup [4k\]: i think this is the site
tromp [-\]: 6.5 is like 5.5
mmueller [4d?\]: G7 is also strong
tromp [-\]: and 7.5 like 8.5
mmueller [4d?\]: oops :)
yank [?\]: Ya, I am from Taiwan.
Archaic [1d\]: what
kuy30 [1d\]: that's the move
tromp [-\]: since even area difference unlikely
kuy30 [1d\]: he was thinking about
mmueller [4d?\]: Fuego also likes G7 at longer search
pasky [-\]: archaic, there is extensive discussion at http://senseis.xmp.net/?WhyChineseKomiShouldIncreaseBy2PointSteps

pasky [-\]: do something crazy with the e5 cut?
mmueller [4d?\]: 45% now

flipflop [4k\]: Chess servers do it

aware [2k\]: whoa
Ukasuhs [1k\]: white is a bot

C[arlefferts [23k\]: strange
CHOWstyle [3k\]: I dont understand c6
DanielFox [-\]: could mean mogo has given up
andrew [3d\]: don't anthropomorphize robots
Zvi [3k\]: i don't either. also i'd guess black would play b7 \
instead of c7
Meepy [-\]: c6 is a peep
arlefferts [23k\]: how does a computer give up?
Nefri89 [9k\]: yeah =)
DanielFox [-\]: andrew, i am not
Nefri89 [9k\]: hah
lonsan [3k\]: yeah is b7 not better?
bolb [-\]: when mogo is losing, it try weird moves
fly [1k\]: when it can't see wins in any lines it plays crazy \
chances
Ukasuhs [1k\]: b7 is really not any better but not any worse
DanielFox [-\]: mogo's moves get random because it is trying to \
maximize a win for a losing proposition
andrew [3d\]: first you anthropomorphize them, then next they're \
enslaving our women, overthrowing our governments, relegating \
us to lives of brutal slavery
pasky [-\]: i wonder what the 9p is doing now
blackdoor [6d\]: computer thinks so long?
lonsan [3k\]: don't you earn one extra point due to a6?
andrew [3d\]: I'm just warning you
pasky [-\]: chatting with others? reading a newspaper?

C[BenMantle [3d\]: that would be two extra
Gynn [13k?\]: lol
Meepy [-\]: c6 makes d4 juicier
Ukasuhs [1k\]: if b played b7 instead he still cant respond to \
a6 with a7 or there will be a big ko
lonsan [3k\]: yeah, two extra
fly [1k\]: ah... counting is what these mogo bots are good at!
BenMantle [3d\]: i dont think the pro's atari was good.  it's \
clear..
Ukasuhs [1k\]: so none extra and none lost
Zvi [3k\]: d4 juice doesn't look like much :p
lonsan [3k\]: ah true
Ukasuhs [1k\]: unless b will risk like 18 points...
lonsan [3k\]: no i think it's right ben
Ukasuhs [1k\]: in ko
blackdoor [6d\]: must be 386
lonsan [3k\]: probably commodore 500
blackdoor [6d\]: so slow
lonsan [3k\]: my comm 500 lags when playing pac man
Ukasuhs [1k\]: b is winning anyway, so he doesnt need to play \
b7. b7 is only better if black has a lot more ko threats than \
white
Gynn [13k?\]: Dans don't play slow like this right?
Ukasuhs [1k\]: otherwise black would end in the same result
andrew [3d\]: well, the computer is calculating /every/ possible \

jabbawocky [1k\]: e5 first
Mercury [5k?\]: f8
jabbawocky [1k\]: e5
pasky [-\]: i think half a point win is brewing for w
Ukasuhs [1k\]: w + 0.5 if he gets a7 a8 a5 b8 
Zvi [3k\]: f8 g8
Mercury [5k?\]: then g 8 then
Mercury [5k?\]: e 8
jabbawocky [1k\]: e5 
BenMantle [3d\]: f 7 made it so that white's j 7 would end in \
sente for sure
Zvi [3k\]: then d8 ..
Mercury [5k?\]: then u push the e5
Mercury [5k?\]: and u force black to kill that
Zvi [3k\]: still doesn't work
Zvi [3k\]: this isn't japanese scoring
Mercury [5k?\]: it does]

C[Mercury [5k?\]: if bottom has no libirties]
WL[669.884];B[gb]
C[Zvi [3k\]: but it does has libs
Zvi [3k\]: and it's chinese rules ..
pasky [-\]: not soon
Mercury [5k?\]: ya
Zvi [3k\]: so white is losing points ..
Ukasuhs [1k\]: w can win
Ukasuhs [1k\]: a7
slinky [-\]: poor mogo bot.
Mercury [5k?\]: but it will not have libirties later
DnFBlitz [1k\]: i wonder if w's endgame at this point is close \
to perfect
Mercury [5k?\]: and then its inevitable
Mercury [5k?\]: what will happen
Zvi [3k\]: :\\
Zvi [3k\]: i'm explaining this isn't japanese rules
jabbawocky [1k\]: e5 clearly best move
Zvi [3k\]: it's chinese rules
Ukasuhs [1k\]: i know

C[Mercury [5k?\]: what is chinese rules?
DonValley [5d?\]: the rules chinese use
jabbawocky [1k\]: w doesnt lose points if b responds
Zvi [3k\]: well, mercury claims that the semidori will cost black \
points
frog [12k\]: why are so many people watc;hing this game
quasimoyo [2d\]: rules from China
Ukasuhs [1k\]: territory and live stones are each 1 point
truman [3d\]: i count w wins by half
Zvi [3k\]: and i'm explaining it wont
Mercury [5k?\]: not now lol
Ukasuhs [1k\]: dead stones are no points for either
blackdoor [6d\]: w +1.5
Troff [?\]: Why does EVERY kgs game's kibitz devolve into a debate \
about Japanese and Chinese counting. WITHOUT FAIL.
Ukasuhs [1k\]: 7.5 komi
BenMantle [3d\]: b + 9 without komi at the end i think
Zvi [3k\]: mercury, in chinese rules playing in your own territory \
doesn't cost points
BenMantle [3d\]: in japanese
truman [3d\]: blackdoor's count is probably better :)
Gynn [13k?\]: Unless Mogo rins out of time =s
Gynn [13k?\]: runs*
Mercury [5k?\]: i dont under stand g 9 tho ;p
pasky [-\]: zvi: it will - w fills dame so gaining extra stones \
on board, while b fills own territory, his score staying the \
same
arpad [?\]: i count b by a half because of A1]
BL[2152.852];W[ac]
C[Ukasuhs [1k\]: if w gets a7 in sente he wins by 0.5
slinky [-\]: no he dont
pasky [-\]: zvi: japanese and chinese rules are much more similar \
point-wise than one would think]
WL[561.493];B[ab]
C[iTengen [5k\]: yeah but in semedori you get dame which is worth \
points, while your opponent fills in her territory, which isnt
Mercury [5k?\]: what is komi?
Ukasuhs [1k\]: because e5 is sente and then after a1 e1 f1 b cant \
play f3
iTengen [5k\]: baby dont hurt me?
jabbawocky [1k\]: chinese and jap scoring differ by a max of one \
point, thats why the komi is one point higher
Zvi [3k\]: but semidori still doesn't make one lose points pasky
kuy30 [1d\]: b will try to kill
CptObvious [?\]: Troff, that is new, actually there should be \
a discussion, wether white is tartrate...
slinky [-\]: komi is .5 points or 6.5 to white for going second
blackdoor [6d\]: w should e5 f1 first
slinky [-\]: and to prevent ties
pasky [-\]: zvi: yes but w will _gain_ points
Ukasuhs [1k\]: komi is 7.5...]

DonValley [5d?\]: lol chinese japanese rules might not matter \
anymore
pasky [-\]: zvi: in japanese rules w score is same but b loses \
points - in chinese rules w score is gaining while b stays the \
same - the end effect is the same
truman [3d\]: it doesn't work.
