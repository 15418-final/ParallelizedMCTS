If you passed and I did not, it often means that the status of some stones are not clear enough for me (I want to be sure we will agree on dead stones). Clarify them. Maybe I am losing, but have not enough time to be sure I should resign. In this case play until the end :'( (very rare cases)

mstarsup5 [6d?\]: g3 should be e9
yoyoma [1d\]: if black get e9, he can still play g3 for safety
yoyoma [1d\]: it's strange that mogo doesn't think e9 would increase it's % to win
jnr [-\]: not very fair ... to resign now
jnr [-\]: ^^
fotland [?\]: is strange.
fotland [?\]: I just checked Many Faces
mstarsup5 [6d?\]: nice game, thanks to both players
fotland [?\]: it gives e9 64%, g3 59% (#2 move)
fotland [?\]: very good game
COCKBOAT [?\]: indeed
fotland [?\]: I looked at e9 first, then g3, then d2.  it seems white still wins.
tanguo [?\]: who is teytaud,how is his d?
