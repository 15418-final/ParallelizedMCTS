C[Mogo [-\]: GTP Engine for Mogo (white): MoGo version 3.0.0: I'll \
resign if you win and playing until you pass if I win. If you \
passed and I did not, it often means that the status of some \
stones are not clear enough for me (I want to be sure we will \
agree on dead stones). Clarify them. Maybe I am losing, but have \
not enough time to be sure I should resign. In this case play \
until the end :'( (very rare cases)]

ElAlmaZen [8k\]: 7.8  is not enough for small board
Zeid [2d\]: its too much
dionisio [9k\]: nice, i hope 9 p win this match, mogo has been \
beating all those players
josette [1d\]: so much time to play!!
ElAlmaZen [8k\]: on the contrary
ElAlmaZen [8k\]: B first move is too big
josette [1d\]: what's the mater mogo
ElAlmaZen [8k\]: komi is to compensate that
Zeid [2d\]: go seigen said it should be 3,5
Zeid [2d\]: komi
ElAlmaZen [8k\]: mogo is meditatin

Mercury [2k\]: i rate 5
NattyIce [1k\]: seigen sayanything about 19 zeid?

possible
NattyIce [1k\]: i now but did he about 19 also?
ElAlmaZen [8k\]: lets help mogo: ommmm
NattyIce [1k\]: know*
Zeid [2d\]: seigen changed it from 5,5 to 6,5 in 19x19
NattyIce [1k\]: thx
Mercury [2k\]: 19 needs more than 9 lol
Mercury [2k\]: 7.5 is fine in 19

elohimmeth [1k\]: whats going on, can computer think?
wolfey [-\]: ^_^
Tsu123 [12k\]: mogo likes to repeat himself =/
Pae [3k\]: computers can compute
ElAlmaZen [8k\]: shh
Mercury [2k\]: c4 mogo
alexanro [6k\]: elohimmeth: it tries loads and loads of random \
games for each possible move, and picks the move that wins the \
most games, as far as I've understood
ElAlmaZen [8k\]: let the poor bot think
Samowar [1d\]: hmm
Zvi [3k\]: is he "considering" c7 ?
ElAlmaZen [8k\]: C4 is not in the manual
Samowar [1d\]: it's a monte carlo based program, right?
Pae [3k\]: then it should think the same on a pentium 1, just \
use a LOT more time
josette [1d\]: c5
alexanro [6k\]: yes
Mercury [2k\]: why whats wrong with c4
Tsu123 [12k\]: i like c5
Pae [3k\]: is there something wrong with it?
weirdchess [10k\]: c4 looks better than c5 to me
Mercury [2k\]: c4 c5 b3 b 6
Abaddon [5d\]: C4 is bad, C5 is even worse.
josette [1d\]: may be B6
MrZNF [11k\]: it isn't, c5 ftw :)
ElAlmaZen [8k\]: c5? haha
Mercury [2k\]: its not the best
Euphorie [-\]: c4 ->b3
Pae [3k\]: i would never c5 for sure
Mercury [2k\]: but i dont see what the hell b 5 does anyway
elohimmeth [1k\]: c4 b3 is okey for w
Samowar [1d\]: Abaddon the worst
ElAlmaZen [8k\]: C3 maybe
CGBSpender [4d\]: what does montecarlo do in comparison with anything \
else ?
Pae [3k\]: c5 is "banging your head into the wall"
weirdchess [10k\]: what are you thinking? c7?
Mercury [2k\]: c4 gives black top half tho
ElAlmaZen [8k\]: C5 is jachoon soo, right
Euphorie [-\]: well yeah b3 doesn't work
MrZNF [11k\]: C5 is either getting the corner or the stone or \
escaping I think :)
ElAlmaZen [8k\]: b3 = I resign
jungle [1d\]: hi
Samowar [1d\]: yo
Mercury [2k\]: i think mogo will resign
MrZNF [11k\]: maybe he will tenuki
Zvi [3k\]: lol
Mercury [2k\]: lol
Euphorie [-\]: w should win this]
BL[2807.36];W[cf]
C[alexanro [6k\]: CGBSpender: "statistical brute force", in a way, \
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Go#Monte-Carlo_methods
Mercury [2k\]: c4
slinky [-\]: white wont
Mercury [2k\]: see
weirdchess [10k\]: there's no such thing as tenuki in 9x9
ElAlmaZen [8k\]: finally
MrZNF [11k\]: =(]
WL[2555.848];B[ce]
C[Mercury [2k\]: im good hey
CGBSpender [4d\]: i bet on white
Mercury [2k\]: i think like a bot
Mercury [2k\]: b3!
Euphorie [-\]: black in trouble
josette [1d\]: good mercurey is mentor of mogo
MrZNF [11k\]: white now has to play B3
weirdchess [10k\]: b3 is obviously forced here
Mercury [2k\]: ye
Mercury [2k\]: what the heck esle can it do
Mercury [2k\]: resign?
josette [1d\]: b6
aware [2k\]: exactly same game as the 1st they played up to now
ElAlmaZen [8k\]: wake me up when Mogo plays B3
Zvi [3k\]: this is starting to look like mogos and nutngo last \
game
weirdchess [10k\]: what happened in the first?
CGBSpender [4d\]: and who had won, aware ?
Mercury [2k\]: 0.5?
Mercury [2k\]: mogo 0.5?
aware [2k\]: the pro by resignation
Zvi [3k\]: in the last one nutngo owned mogo completely
Mercury [2k\]: im thinkin of last nite
Zvi [3k\]: oh
Samowar [1d\]: i'd b6 as well
Mercury [2k\]: why cant mogo play 19x19
Mercury [2k\]: is it too much for him?
CGBSpender [4d\]: it takes lot of time
Korlon [2k\]: He could
requires [1d\]: mogo prefers a 1% chance to win, vs losign by \
0.5  .  so when it loses, it mostly loses by res.  it doesn't \
mean it was a blowout.
alexanro [6k\]: mogo has
Mercury [2k\]: play 1 move every day?
mattpk [11k\]: a9 a8 b9 b8 c9 c8 d9 d8 e9 e8 f9 f8 g9 g8 h9 h8 \
h7 j9 h6 j7 h5 j6 j5 j4 c4 
mattpk [11k\]: nvm
Korlon [2k\]: Should make mogo play on DGS
alexanro [6k\]: Mercury: check the wikipedia link I found a bit \
further up. At the end of that paragraph, a 19x19 is mentioned
taodoc [15k\]: dumb
aware [2k\]: mercury> it can... and it beat a 9p and a 1p with \
7handy(against 9p) and 6handy (even though the rematch it lost \
both times)
Mercury [2k\]: put mogo against another bot
ElAlmaZen [8k\]: A9???
jungle [1d\]: a9 good move
spirito [1k\]: isn't b6 possible here ?
weirdchess [10k\]: he's counting points, not moves elalmazen
Mercury [2k\]: it cant win with no handi tho
xinwen [-\]: haha the computer isn't good enough to "think" faster
Mercury [2k\]: b6 is useless
alexanro [6k\]: xinwen: one can decide how long mogo should think, \
longer gives better results]
BL[2801.78];W[bg]WL[2327.333];B[bd]
C[Mercury [2k\]: b3 yep
Mercury [2k\]: LD:
Mercury [2k\]: a4!
heather [2d\]: is mogo's opening book being updated by these games?
Mercury [2k\]: pro remembers exact moves
ElAlmaZen [8k\]: mogo doesnt know openings
Mercury [2k\]: and going to play them again cuz bot cant evolve?
Mercury [2k\]: lol
heather [2d\]: hmm I swear I remember mogo having opening plays \
for small boards. Maybe it was crazystone
aware [2k\]: still same game as their first ... mogo now a4, nutngo \
e2:)
weirdchess [10k\]: mogo definitely knows openings - it always \
blitzes out the first 2-3 moves in one second
alexanro [6k\]: Mercury: the bot uses probability, so it's likely \
that it won't repeat the same patterns again and again
ElAlmaZen [8k\]: bots dont evolve, stop reading sci-fi comics
Mercury [2k\]: ahh
Mercury [2k\]: does it have memory
ElAlmaZen [8k\]: bots are machines
ElAlmaZen [8k\]: only real beings evolve
alexanro [6k\]: don't think so
aware [2k\]: alexanro> up to now it did:)
weirdchess [10k\]: though there are machine-learning algorithms
alexanro [6k\]: aware: oh, ok :)
Mercury [2k\]: then it cant remember
Mercury [2k\]: when it lost.
CptObvious [?\]: ElAlmaZen, you obviously haven't heard of skynet \
before ;)
zazi: programs evolve
Mercury [2k\]: no
Mercury [2k\]: programers evlove programs
ElAlmaZen [8k\]: bot is a computer program only improves if the \
programmer wants to
Mercury [2k\]: lol
Mercury [2k\]: maby in 10 years
Mercury [2k\]: skynet !
Tsu123 [12k\]: what is skynet
ElAlmaZen [8k\]: go mogo go
Mercury [2k\]: its terminator 
alexanro [6k\]: Mercury: are you afraid of the idea that computer \
programs can learn and be creative?
Tsu123 [12k\]: ?
Mercury [2k\]: no
ElAlmaZen [8k\]: haha
ElAlmaZen [8k\]: affraid,wow
Mercury [2k\]: why would i be
Mercury [2k\]: im a computer program
Tsu123 [12k\]: that will smith movie
CptObvious [?\]: tsu: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088247/
Mercury [2k\]: :D
calbonga [13k\]: play there!
Mercury [2k\]: a4!
Tsu123 [12k\]: thanks]
BL[2798.001];W[af]
C[Mercury [2k\]: yes!
Mercury [2k\]: well done mogo
xinwen [-\]: FIRST BLOOD
josette [1d\]: mercury 100%
aware [2k\]: e2 would be repetition of last game... im curious:)
Mercury [2k\]: i cant predict black
jungle [1d\]: stoned
zazi: quit helping him
Mercury [2k\]: too hard
Mercury [2k\]: only mogo
ElAlmaZen [8k\]: this mogo is running in a 486?
weirdchess [10k\]: interesting - the pro doesnt have a response \
prepared]
WL[2114.385];B[eh]
C[heather [2d\]: first captured stone(s) should be worth more points
Mercury [2k\]: oh!
aware [2k\]: yeah:)
alexanro [6k\]: :
xinwen [-\]: -,-
Mercury [2k\]: i was thinking d 2 guess e2 was better
Mercury [2k\]: attacks both sides
jungle [1d\]: this game sucks
weirdchess [10k\]: g7 here?
aware [2k\]: g6 now again or is there another candidate with  \
probability high enough?
zazi: life in the jungle
ElAlmaZen [8k\]: yes Jungle, next game you play with Mogo
calbonga [13k\]: anyone saw mogo"S straight line game yesterday
ElAlmaZen [8k\]: ok?
fringd [1k\]: w owes b a move
jungle [1d\]: ?
fringd [1k\]: b can c2
weirdchess [10k\]: why g6 instead of g7?
heather [2d\]: well um allowing b c2 sucks
chipper [-\]: aware, please predict game till end :)
Zvi [3k\]: straight line game ?
chipper [-\]: I think you can do it.
calbonga [13k\]: yep
Zvi [3k\]: what's that ?
zazi: there's life in the jungle
calbonga [13k\]: nothing
mrhackett [7k\]: well, no doubt he can....
Zvi [3k\]: :/
PikkuKiusa [3k\]: loool
calbonga [13k\]: yesterday mogo just played in one straight line
Mercury [2k\]: well top is big
PikkuKiusa [3k\]: 50 minutes and 9x9
Mercury [2k\]: but bot has 1 eye
chipper [-\]: g6 is now
alexanro [6k\]: w c8, w d3, w d2, w g6 or somewhere else?
fringd [1k\]: yeah only a computer has the patience to spend 50 \
on 9x9
chipper [-\]: G6, G7, D3, H7,
weirdchess [10k\]: is white dead after black c2?
Mercury [2k\]: think so
jungle [1d\]: yes
weirdchess [10k\]: it looks like yes to me
Mercury [2k\]: so bot will play c 2?
ElAlmaZen [8k\]: C4 first?
aware [2k\]: g6 g7 d3 h7 f2 e3 d2 d1 c6 c7 a6 b7 
jungle [1d\]: b7
chipper [-\]: It will be funny if the same game occurs
Mercury [2k\]: then pro will win
jungle [1d\]: b4
royalty [3d\]: nah, a6
chipper [-\]: Aware :)
Mercury [2k\]: with g 6
ElAlmaZen [8k\]: C7 i mean]
BL[2757.933];W[gd]
C[royalty [3d\]: harr]
WL[1917.22]
;B[gc]
C[heather [2d\]: hmm!
chipper [-\]: Now, everyone follow along with aware
Mercury [2k\]: i guess it wasnt dead
chipper [-\]: And enjoy the show :)
fringd [1k\]: b seems ok
aware [2k\]: :) ... questio is if it sees some move that has same \
probablity to win than the ones it played last time
Mercury [2k\]: h 7 i guess
mmueller [4d?\]: h7
fringd [1k\]: black just counted
fringd [1k\]: can win without killing
Mercury [2k\]: but it wont die surely
weirdchess [10k\]: why g6 over g7?  didn't g7 grab more?
ElAlmaZen [8k\]: what is aware talking about?
Vinicius [1d\]: killing? o.O
Mercury [2k\]: cuz mogo knows all?
ElAlmaZen [8k\]: i cant follow
weirdchess [10k\]: white g7, black g6, white h6 looked safe to \
me
Mercury [2k\]: g7 is weak shape
Mercury [2k\]: was
Mercury [2k\]: black could take sente as well then maby
Mercury [2k\]: come mogo h7 is ur only option surely
fringd [1k\]: i see c2 no good
chipper [-\]: it must play d3 or else death
fringd [1k\]: c2, b2, c3
Mercury [2k\]: c2 doesnt work
chipper [-\]: so it will recreate losing position
Mercury [2k\]: i mean mogo
Mercury [2k\]: would know?]
BL[2753.155];W[cd]
C[solarstar [6k\]: i wish they play 19x19 already
fringd [1k\]: no c2 b2, c3
Mercury [2k\]: i dont know i dont doubt mogo tho
aware [2k\]: ah - change!
Mercury [2k\]: LLOL
Cookies [6k\]: o.o..
fringd [1k\]: c2 does work
weirdchess [10k\]: ?
chipper [-\]: not change..
ElAlmaZen [8k\]: fight fight
chipper [-\]: this is just different order of moves
ElAlmaZen [8k\]: go mogo go
chipper [-\]: still same position
Korlon [2k\]: On what date was the other game like this one?
Zvi [3k\]: okay. this game happened already right ?
Mercury [2k\]: what is this aiming at hmm
miago [1d\]: what was the time date of that game chipper?
Cookies [6k\]: i think he wants b to c7
Korlon [2k\]: C7 here
Mercury [2k\]: i never saw last one
Cookies [6k\]: then e5
aware [2k\]: true chipper :)
chipper [-\]: Zvi, mogo is playing similar to first game he played \
against black
ElAlmaZen [8k\]: this is confusing the human]
WL[1735.853];B[cc]
C[ElAlmaZen [8k\]: bot are clever
Mercury [2k\]: bot gave a way a point
Zvi [3k\]: it looks nearly exactly like the last game :(
weirdchess [10k\]: im guessing white a6 here?
heather [2d\]: I dubt b is confused
Mercury [2k\]: a 5?
Mercury [2k\]: 6
weirdchess [10k\]: or is mogo going to pull a mogo and go d6 or \
something?
jungle [1d\]: b4
ElAlmaZen [8k\]: see 9p is in doubt
ElAlmaZen [8k\]: go mogo
YOGI [12k\]: your rooting for the computer?
Mercury [2k\]: d4 u mean
solarstar [6k\]: mo go suks wat r u elma a robot?
josette [1d\]: mogo founds this move in a bad game
Korlon [2k\]: So is he going to D3 now?
ElAlmaZen [8k\]: be nice with the poor bot
Cookies [6k\]: mogo doesn't suck >:(
Akagi316 [7k?\]: has bot won one yet
Cookies [6k\]: yes
Cookies [6k\]: won first 2
Mercury [2k\]: he won won last nite
chipper [-\]: Now I want to see if mogo changes..
Mercury [2k\]: mogo isnt going to change
jungle [1d\]: cant change i think
Mercury [2k\]: he isnt like the weather
reggel [-\]: mogo is probably alll like... can not compute... \
can not compute... SELF DESTRUCT
reggel [-\]: :)
jungle [1d\]: :
chipper [-\]: then it'll be the same?
jungle [1d\]: :)
josette [1d\]: and what the weather like
chipper [-\]: d3, h7?
chipper [-\]: just in different order
Mercury [2k\]: not at all its more like compute compute compute \
more compiute
Mercury [2k\]: and then keep computing
Mercury [2k\]: and make same move]
BL[2699.462];W[dg]
C[ElAlmaZen [8k\]: i told them to buy good machine oil
Korlon [2k\]: Haha, D3
weirdchess [10k\]: h6]
WL[1574.682];B[dh]
C[Mercury [2k\]: is it the same?
josette [1d\]: fine bot psychology mercury
mmueller [4d?\]: oh no
chipper [-\]: h7 weirdchess
Korlon [2k\]: Aww, black changed
chipper [-\]: h6 would be gote
reggel [-\]: why mogo go c6?
fringd [1k\]: b read this already
xinwen [-\]: B+R
chipper [-\]: haha yes
Korlon [2k\]: Black should've played H7
aware [2k\]: oh - b answerd different than last time
reggel [-\]: why hello shana
chipper [-\]: well d2 still sente
Zvi [3k\]: really? looks like last time
aware [2k\]: korlon> b did h7 last time this position occured
Zvi [3k\]: oh
Zvi [3k\]: right :/
josette [1d\]: and what if E3 now
jungle [1d\]: h7 NOW HAHAHAHA
Mercury [2k\]: but maby this guy is going for gold
Mercury [2k\]: whole board distruction
Korlon [2k\]: Did this guy watch that specific game?
Ho [3k?\]: d4 
reggel [-\]: D4?
solarstar [6k\]: black should h7
Zvi [3k\]: f2?
Renen [15k\]: I find it funny that so many think they know better \
than the pro player >_<
Pizat19 [3k\]: black should wait for his turn :P
Mercury [2k\]: nonono mogo knows best
reggel [-\]: maybe I am a pro?
solarstar [6k\]: well we areXD
jungle [1d\]: we are all pro here
Ho [3k?\]: c2  maybe
Zvi [3k\]: isn't w: f2 good ?
alexanro [6k\]: Renen: you're 15k, you're supposed to suggest \
moves, not be all insightful ;)
solarstar [6k\]: accept u
Mercury [2k\]: pro go?
sasa86 [5k\]: when watching a pro game everyone's a pro
reggel [-\]: ever think about that? maybe my rank is hidden so \
no one knows im a 4p?
sasa86 [5k\]: like soccer
weirdchess [10k\]: i'm pro in a totally amateur way]
BL[2686.676];W[ad]
C[Renen [15k\]: I have been shut down too many times alexanro :P]
WL[1439.594];B[bc]
C[reggel [-\]: SUFI!
Zvi [3k\]: usually when p eople suggest moves rather throwing \
them claiming they are correct, they are more welcome renen
Mercury [2k\]: h7
zazi: a6 only a program knows why
fringd [1k\]: b will get h7
fringd [1k\]: w still owes c2
weirdchess [10k\]: mogo really only plays simple geometric structures \
... straight line or small diagonals
solarstar [6k\]: h7 or face deafeat black
Korlon [2k\]: Don't we all do that?
Mercury [2k\]: no
aware [2k\]: weird> you should watch it on 19x19 ... and it has \
no concept of "shape"
Korlon [2k\]: I see lines from black here
CGBSpender [4d\]: C2 is sente on b's group
reggel [-\]: mogo gotta go H7... O
Mercury [2k\]: we think in patterns
weirdchess [10k\]: i've seen it on 19x19... it plays so well for \
the first 30 moves then it starts playing like a 25kyu
Mercury [2k\]: and we memorize patterns
Korlon [2k\]: Mogo's self ataris are hilarious
reggel [-\]: we 25K are a proud people!
Mercury [2k\]: ya it gets confused
josette [1d\]: c2 is sente on B's  group ?   can you explain]
BL[2682.504];W[ch]
C[Mercury [2k\]: cuz theres too much possibility]
WL[1314.64];B[hd]
C[aware [2k\]: weird> funny that this 25k  has beaten a 9p with \
7 handy and a 1p with 6handy:)
fringd [1k\]: b is bored
Zvi [3k\]: wow h6
CGBSpender [4d\]: e3 f3 f2 g2 e5

josette [1d\]: ok thx
Bonushand [9k\]: 7.5
Mercury [2k\]: 9?
Mercury [2k\]: 1d
Korlon [2k\]: Depends on what dan you're talking about
weirdchess [10k\]: CGB's line is really interesting - would the \
bottom black structure die then CGB?
Mercury [2k\]: a kgs dan 
CGBSpender [4d\]: yes
solarstar [6k\]: 25 k can beat 9 p with 36 handi
fringd [1k\]: e3 f3 f2 d4, CGBSpender
CGBSpender [4d\]: but black will not get tricked, he will sacrifice \
the tail
wayward [1k\]: B+2.5
jungle [1d\]: f2 d4 i said
reggel [-\]: chinese stlye handi
Mercury [2k\]: ye the more handi u make its easier
aware [2k\]: seems like b is trying to put  more pressure to w \
than last time and see how it reacts
Variable [1d\]: there is no sacrifice
CGBSpender [4d\]: i know that
reggel [-\]: not always
Mercury [2k\]: anything over 9 gets stupid
royalty [3d\]: komi is not going to be enough?
wayward [1k\]: nope
wayward [1k\]: :)
weirdchess [10k\]: what about e3 f3 d4?
wayward [1k\]: I predict B+2.5
reggel [-\]: unless you have a ridiculous handi
Mercury [2k\]: then they can use basic lines
solarstar [6k\]: push to lose sente?
weirdchess [10k\]: then white double threatens e5 and f2
CGBSpender [4d\]: it's the same whatever order is played
Mercury [2k\]: and just play "connect the dots"
Mercury [2k\]: and win
CGBSpender [4d\]: white will use the weakness
reggel [-\]: go mogo go mogo go go mogo go mogo go!
solarstar [6k\]: and he call him self 9p

reggel [-\]: how so?
calbonga [13k\]: how come Mogo is always takin so long?
solarstar [6k\]: cux im 10000p
kuy30 [1d\]: only possibilities of result are W+0.5 and B+R
Zvi [3k\]: he's wise
Mercury [2k\]: come mogo if u dont h 5 ur stones will dine
Korlon [2k\]: Needs processing time
wayward [1k\]: Mogo is reading
calbonga [13k\]: idk
Mercury [2k\]: FF
reggel [-\]: because robots need a long time to think!
alexanro [6k\]: calbonga: the people running the mogo program \
can decide how long Mogo should think
solarstar [6k\]: so HA!
calbonga [13k\]: grr
reggel [-\]: lolololololol
reggel [-\]: lolz
calbonga [13k\]: ok I get it

Mercury [2k\]: ya
wayward [1k\]: "stupid" is a virtue of humans only
Mercury [2k\]: well f7 is the best
Zvi [3k\]: don't like it :/
CGBSpender [4d\]: white wants H5 sente
CGBSpender [4d\]: nice
Mercury [2k\]: then he needs j7
McStylez [2k\]: H5 was sente without g8
Mercury [2k\]: who has more libirties
solarstar [6k\]: u all suk
Zvi [3k\]: would have said the mcstylez, if the one saying that \
wasn't 4d ;/
matthos [11k\]: what game is this?

admins here

Mercury [2k\]: black will win
reggel [-\]: no u
solarstar [6k\]: U suk more regel
chipper [-\]: reggel...
weirdchess [10k\]: j7 works for black, no? its a bit riskier but \
i'm pretty sure white dies before black
CGBSpender [4d\]: white wins this game
chipper [-\]: and solarstar
elohimmeth [1k\]: black gone
Mercury [2k\]: yes
gaudy [10k?\]: who is mogo playing?
solarstar [6k\]: suk is not cursing
sweety [-\]: solarstar, thats enough..

Mercury [2k\]: black and white group have same libirties
reggel [-\]: ...I will not object your athourty
weirdchess [10k\]: jun xun zhou 9p
matthos [11k\]: who is nutngo?
calbonga [13k\]: a player
Mercury [2k\]: but black is first
wayward [1k\]: nutngo is a shared account
calbonga [13k\]: a human
wayward [1k\]: see MOTD
reggel [-\]: how ever you may spell athourty
chipper [-\]: Also, see nutngo's info for more information.
calbonga [13k\]: plural human
aware [2k\]: b is http://senseis.xmp.net/?ZhouJunxun
calbonga [13k\]: humanS
fringd [1k\]: b +5 at least
fringd [1k\]: mogo is acting up
calbonga [13k\]: f7
reggel [-\]: what's taking nutngo so long?
aware [2k\]: time stopped... nutngo connectin problems?
calbonga [13k\]: this seems a bit complicated
aware [2k\]: connection*
Mercury [2k\]: ya
solarstar [6k\]: yuh
alexanro [6k\]: escape? ;)
Mercury [2k\]: nutngo had power failure
Mercury [2k\]: jsut phoned me to say
weirdchess [10k\]: black j7 stops h5 from being sente, as opposed \
to f7
reggel [-\]: solarstar, this is all your fault!... jk, jk... don't \
respond... and don't kick me admins
miago [1d\]: The reason for these strange w moves: They increase \
the computing horizon. This way w's positions looks better than.
Zvi [3k\]: computing horizon ?
Rajan [23k\]: More options
Zvi [3k\]: thanks
Mercury [2k\]: who stands at the top of the go world >\]
fringd [1k\]: mogo can read that he will lose, but he can only \
read so far, so he plays weird moves to extend the game because \
unknown seems better than known failure
wayward [1k\]: good explanation, fringd
Zvi [3k\]: oh
alexanro [6k\]: yes, nice
Zvi [3k\]: makes more sense now
Zvi [3k\]: thanks
fringd [1k\]: e5 a little spooky
Mercury [2k\]: i no squat about go
Mercury [2k\]: i started last week
calbonga [13k\]: did nutty escape?
Mercury [2k\]: btw
calbonga [13k\]: no
Mercury [2k\]: so whos the best?
Zvi [3k\]: me
calbonga [13k\]: maybe mogo escaped
wayward [1k\]: why don't they place their figures in the fields
Mercury [2k\]: mogo is the best?
alexanro [6k\]: I can try loading the game on my computer and \
try running it with Mogo
wayward [1k\]: is it a graphics problem?
alexanro [6k\]: wonder what the difference in moves would be
Rajan [23k\]: You're 2K and you only started last week? O.o
calbonga [13k\]: nutngo is da best
Mercury [2k\]: yeye
jungle [1d\]: i started 2 months ago
Zvi [3k\]: he's trolling
Mercury [2k\]: last week
matthos [11k\]: he's lying mang
calbonga [13k\]: nutngo is 7dan right?
Mercury [2k\]: i was 9d in chess
wayward [1k\]: I started 7 months ago
weirdchess [10k\]: there is no 9d in chess...
Mercury [2k\]: ye the equivalent
Rajan [23k\]: I started last month and I've barely gotten any \
better >.<
calbonga [13k\]: but in shogi
Mercury [2k\]: chess master
Zvi [3k\]: merc
weirdchess [10k\]: nutngo is junxun zhou 9p calbonga

C[basicpract [-\]: he is back :)
Mercury [2k\]: is shougi same rules as chess
Mercury [2k\]: with flat pieces?
myongstu [-\]: no
calbonga [13k\]: try shogidojo.com
Mercury [2k\]: ok
Mercury [2k\]: well i saw shougi on this one anime
Mogo [-\]: GTP Engine for Mogo (white): MoGo version 3.0.0: I'll \
resign if you win and playing until you pass if I win. If you \
passed and I did not, it often means that the status of some \
stones are not clear enough for me (I want to be sure we will \
agree on dead stones). Clarify them. Maybe I am losing, but have \
not enough time to be sure I should resign. In this case play \
until the end :'( (very rare cases)
Mercury [2k\]: it looked like chess with flat pieces :P
alexanro [6k\]: yey, the game is on again
Mercury [2k\]: yay
Mercury [2k\]: mogo didnt escape
