;W[bf]WL[767.303]C[gunnar [?\]: Nobody, it learnt it by playing on CGOS.
gunnar [?\]: But this looks good for white.
]
;B[gd]BL[799.095]C[enz: do you know by how much the self-learned book makes MonteGNU stronger?
]
;W[eb]WL[746.045]C[gunnar [?\]: No, I haven't tested that but the thought has been on my mind.

;B[gc]BL[770.983]
;W[gb]WL[725.847]C[enz: I am wondering if there is too much noise, because some move may be good only against weak opponents
gunnar [?\]: While the MoGo version with opening book and nakade weaknesses played on CGOS it was probably worth a lot.
]
;B[ec]BL[742.858]C[gunnar [?\]: It regularly got 20 moves from the book then.
]
;W[bd]WL[701.425]
;B[hb]BL[711.894]C[gunnar [?\]: It only learns from losses against any player and wins against stronger players.
]
;W[ha]WL[682.339]C[gunnar [?\]: So no noise from weak players.
enz: I see
]
;B[ib]BL[680.915]C[gunnar [?\]: Only noise from strong players. :-)
